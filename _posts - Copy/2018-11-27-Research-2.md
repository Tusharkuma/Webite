Research Stage 2,
26/11/18 - 3/11/18:


Parts:

 For my first prototype (P1), I chose to use the most simple equipment I could find to mock-up the power system for my motor. For this test, I just wanted to produce a mock-up that would allow me to adjust the speed of the motor with a throttle of some kind, using batteries which are similar in voltage to those I plan to use in my final version.

Here are the parts I used:

 Motor:

 ESC:

 Batteries:

 Arduino Uno:

 I also used some jumper wires and a 50k Ohm linear, sliding potentiometer, as listed in the tutorial I used [here](http://rztronics.com/control-brushless-motor-using-arduino/)

 **Bench Test***

 Electronics:

Laser cut mount to enable clamping to desk:

All set up:

 Results:

 The motor increases and decreases RPM as the potentiometer is adjusted. Now that I know the control works, I can build a way of mounting the setup onto a bike for a first working mock-up.
