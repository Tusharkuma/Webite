Research Stage 1,
19/11/18 - 26/11/18:

I began by researching the different types of e-bikes and the history of e-bikes overall. After settling on the friction drive as the variant which best fits my project, I looked into the existing friction drive offerings, both D.I.Y. and commercial. I found friction drive designs from the late 1800s until now. I particularly noticed the recent trend in popularity of small friction drive kits being released, often through crowdfunding. I think this recent popularity is due, at least partly, to the recent decrease in price in battery and motor technology. These offerings are still quite expensive for many, as a result, some detailed, open, D.I.Y. versions have arisen. I have found these to be very useful the research for my project as well as the commercial versions.
